        <img src = '/images/trace.png' width = 200/>
        <p> 
        I was born and raised in a small town in central Kentucky. 
        I lived there for 18 years and then left on my mission to Paraguay,
        while I was gone, my family moved to Florida. <br/>I have been at BYU studying Computer Science
         for nearly three years now, and I love it. I look forward to continuing my education.
