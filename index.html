        <p> 
        I was born and raised in a small town in central Kentucky. 
        I lived there for 18 years and then left on my mission to Paraguay,
        while I was gone, my family moved to Florida. I have been at BYU studying Computer Science
         for nearly three years now, and I love it. I look forward to continuing my education. I grew up playing soccer, basketball, and volleyball,
         however, I also enjoyed hiking. I have hiked over 400 miles on the Appalaichain Trail! If I am invited to anything outdoors or active, I guarantee
          I will go, even if its something I have never done before.
          <br/>

          I am also dating a girl named Clara, we have been dating for about 2 months now, and it is going very well! Here is a picture that describes us pretty well. This was right after I beat her in a board game... again.
